# ***Darrkon Network***
Darrkon Network is a small company dedicated to developing web soloutions. We make closed-source affordable proxies chock-full of tools, games, and fast browsing for contries that develop firewalls to block certain sites to restrict freedom of speech, like schools,Countries without freedom of speech.  

Our biggest projects are 
- ***Bloodlust & Brutality*** a game that I am working on in Unity, a goal for being a developer in [New Blood Interactive](https://www.google.com/search?q=New+Blood+Interactive+Pulblisher)
- ***DARRKON*** a proxy and an operating system. Right now terrible, but a version 500x better coming soon. [Darrkon v9.7](https://darrkonv9.vercel.app)
- ***DEVELOPER IN ELUSION SERVICES*** We are trying to grow our community and other stuff. Most of our developers work in [Elusion Services](https://discord.gg/fGPVFYm46U)

Our company has earned fair income. We are *attempting* to get better at what we do every day.
We try not to steal code from others... But again. 98Corbins. Bog. Voucan. All of them.
We're not perfect, we admit. But try our services. It'll be worth it,by far.
Refunds by PayPal or Cash.

Any forks that I have had have not been modified to say they are mine. 
Game ports are legal with the developer's permission (and/or) DMCA Takedown Requests.


We also have a few music and game projects that are in development and closed-source.
Note that this group is a small organization of teens that like to develop random sh1t.
